# Shaastra RC Final 2020

***About the Competition***
+ Contestants will be given the executable (for Linux, Windows and Mac OS)
+ They then have to provide input to the executable and find out what each part of the program does
+ The contestants then have to write code (in Python/C++) that *exactly* replicates what the executable does
+ If the executable and the contestant's output corresponding to each (hidden) input match, they are awarded points

***Solution***
+ The code used to make the executables (essentially the solution) is added to the ```Solution/``` folder
+ The entire code is given in a single file, the participants will have to upload a seperate file for each subpart
